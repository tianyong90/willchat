##The little story behind Socicon
Socicon was created to give people an easy way to customize social icons.  
**Made in France**  
In France we are very proud of our food (sometimes a bit too much)!   Socicon refers to the [saucisson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saucisson), a sort of dry sausage that we eat as an aperitif with a drink, with cheese, in a packed lunch, well we can really eat saucisson any time, anywhere and with anyone!
